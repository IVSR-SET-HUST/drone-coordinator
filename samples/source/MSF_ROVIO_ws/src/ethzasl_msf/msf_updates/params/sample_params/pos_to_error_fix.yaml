#this parameters are used for error estimated
#this is only useful if there is groundtruth data
#if the transformation between the groundtruth and the MSF frame is know it can be set as translation and quaternion
#if it is unknown setting estimate_tf will estimate the transform based on the first ninit_points disregarding given transforms
#for implmented truth and data type you may look at the (simple) python code
#this is best transformation estimate for VH1 (from position frame)
